# resource-blog


The motivation to build this project was to help junior web developers and help them with the resources which they can find and also share their experience. They can also share their issues as well as feedback which can be helpful to other junior web developers.

We build this project as a school project which also enhanced our frontend as well as backend skills.

The biggest problem this website solves is it is going to save lot of time for beginners or junior webdeveloper searching for the right content this website should be one stop shop for discussing issues as well solving issues through articles, videos, ad discussion posts.

As a webdeveloper the biggest thing which we learn was to connect frontend and backend with using controllers

Our project is going to be to go website for the people who are beginners in computer science as well it would be to go resource website for discussions and post related to web development.

There are lot of exciting features about our website but one of the main feature which i would like to to focus is discussion posts, this section would be very useful where every web developer can come and share their experience as well as issues they faced.
